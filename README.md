# Merge-Sort
This Java program implements the Merge Sort algorithm, which is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer principle. The array is recursively divided into two halves until each subarray contains only a single element. These subarrays are then merged back together in a sorted order
